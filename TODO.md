### TODO

*Numbered lists are used to denote order of importance*

#### Important:

1. Make sure lockdown actually works as intended

#### Other:

1. Add weekly as a giveaway req somehow, and possibly a temporary role and/or an achievement for top 3 on the last week's leaderboard
2. Rewrite the level roles system because it's terrible
3. Improve `mass_ban` to cut after a full line instead of halfway through
4. Add error checks for `maths` command for errors such as Overflow

- Add descriptions to achievements without any
- Make an inverse function of `string_to_seconds()` from utils.py and use it to make output from `channel_command_cooldown()` in bot.py nicer, and have `end_log()` in moderation_utils.py include the duration of the punishment which has ended
- Prevent report from breaking when a message without any content is reported, such as an embed
- When discord add dropdowns to modals make a staff application command
